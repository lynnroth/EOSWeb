# EosWeb [![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/qein9sbtlxa7vo86)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/lynnroth/eosweb)

EosWeb is a web based application for controlling ETC Eos lighting desks.  

A simple keypad and a cue list with ability to go to any cue are currently available.

I wrote this both to be able to use at the school I work with as well as to start to learn Blazor.
